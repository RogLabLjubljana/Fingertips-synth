# Fingertips-synth
Fingertips is an intuitive miniature synthesizer with an in-built speaker, played using the method of "laying hands" on the bare PCB.
Fingers touching the signal pads act as a crude signal mixer which
modulates the pitch. The amount of touch-modulation is set using a potentiometer, which enables the synth to produce a variety of sounds, ranging from bassy arpeggiated melodic patterns (at low modulation levels) to frequency modulated metallic timbres (at higher levels).
